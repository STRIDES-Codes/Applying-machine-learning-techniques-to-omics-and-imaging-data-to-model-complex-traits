1-Based on the this review https://go.nature.com/2U5Dicc, we hypothesise that the top  mitochondrial-coding genes may capture the essence of the transcriptomic and methylatio status data, and as such, may constitute a more resolved feature-base.

2-Human mitochondrial protein genes  were  collected from using Web Service Client as described here https://bit.ly/3eDQsqA or by manual download here https://bit.ly/3laNhc6


4-The official/final of gene panels for downstream PCA  will applied to the subset of the mRNA and Methylation  gene data that belong to the above-mentioned panel
