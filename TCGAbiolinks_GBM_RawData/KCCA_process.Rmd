## Data Source


```{r cars}
Survival_status <- read.csv(file = "TCGAbiolinks_GBM_RawData/clinical_11082020.csv",stringsAsFactors = F)
colnames(Survival_status) <- c("SubjectID","DaysToDeath","SurvivalStatus")
datatable(Survival_status)
```

## Data Summary

* Total Sample size: `r length(unique(Survival_status$case_submitter_id))`.
* 


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
